Project Proposal: QuickHire Freelance Platform
Project Idea
QuickHire Inc. is a startup aiming to revolutionize freelance hiring. They want to build a scalable and
secure 3-tier web-based application using Java (NetBeans, Servlets, JSP, and JDBC). The platform
will connect companies looking for freelance professionals with skilled freelancers. The application
will support companies posting jobs, freelancers applying, and admins moderating the platform.
Project Plan (Step-by-Step)
1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis
- Define user roles: Company, Freelancer, Admin
- Document core features: job posting, profile creation, job application, moderation, dispute
resolution
2. Database Design (JDBC + MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Design tables: users, jobs, applications, disputes, messages, reviews
- Create ERD (to be included in next phase)
3. Presentation Layer (JSP + HTML/CSS)
- JSP pages for login, registration, job listings, profile management, admin dashboard
- Responsive design using CSS or Bootstrap (optional)
4. Business Logic Layer (Java Servlets)
- User authentication and session management
- Job posting logic
- Application processing and messaging system
- Admin functionalities: user banning, job approval, dispute resolution
5. Data Access Layer (DAO + JDBC)
- DAO classes for CRUD operations on all database entities
- Secure JDBC operations (use PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection)
6. Integration and Testing
- Unit test DAO methods
- Test servlet interactions with the presentation and database layers
7. Deployment
- Host the application on a local Apache Tomcat server
- Export WAR file from NetBeans for deployment
8. Documentation and Final Report
- Include code documentation, user guide, and system architecture
9. Advanced Features (Phase 2 Enhancements)
- Messaging System: Enable real-time or asynchronous chat between freelancers and companies
- Ratings and Reviews: Allow companies to rate freelancers and vice versa after project
completion
- Job Recommendations: Show suggested jobs to freelancers based on skills and past
applications
- Skill Tags and Filtering: Add skill tags to user profiles and jobs, enable filtering
- Resume Upload and Download: Freelancers can upload resumes, companies can download
them
- Notification System: Alert users of new jobs, messages, application updates
- Admin Analytics Dashboard: Show stats like active users, total jobs, disputes resolved
10. Security and Scalability Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization on all forms
- Role-based access control for Company, Freelancer, Admin
- Use HTTPS in production; secure session management
- PreparedStatements to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Database indexing for faster job searches and queries
11. Future Expansion Possibilities
- Payment Integration: Add milestone-based payments and escrow system
- Mobile App Integration: Expose REST APIs for mobile frontends
- AI Resume Screening: Match freelancers to jobs using natural language processing (NLP)
- Global Language Support: Offer multilingual interfaces for global access
12. Scam and Abuse Reporting System
- Users (freelancers or companies) can report suspicious or abusive behavior.
- Reports are logged in a 'reports' table including reporter, reported user, reason, and timestamp.
- Admin dashboard includes a section to view, investigate, and take action (warn, suspend, delete
accounts).
- Email notifications can be sent to admins upon new reports.
- Optionally, maintain a 'strike' system for repeat offenders before automatic suspension.
