# QuickHire Project Submission Guide

Follow these steps to properly prepare your QuickHire project for submission:

## Step 1: Download the Project Files

1. Download all project files from this environment
2. Create a new folder on your computer named "QuickHire"
3. Extract the downloaded files into this folder

## Step 2: Clean Up the Project

Remove these unnecessary files and folders:
- `.git` folder (if present)
- `.replit` file
- `.upm` folder
- `node_modules` folder (you can mention in your submission that this folder was removed to reduce submission size)
- Any `.bak` files
- `local-server.js` file
- Any files with `.original` or `.new` extensions

## Step 3: Rename Files

1. Rename `server.js.clean` to `server.js` (replacing the original server.js)

## Step 4: Verify Project Structure

Ensure your final project structure looks like this:
```
QuickHire/
├── src/
│   └── main/
│       ├── java/        # Java backend code
│       └── webapp/      # Frontend assets
│           ├── css/     # Stylesheets
│           ├── js/      # JavaScript files
│           └── *.html   # HTML pages
├── server.js           # Node.js server
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── run.sh              # Startup script
```

## Step 5: Optional - Test Locally

Before submission, you can test the project locally:
1. Install Node.js if you don't have it
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the QuickHire folder
4. Run `npm install http-server express body-parser cors mysql2 pg`
5. Run `node server.js`
6. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000/test-dashboard.html

## Step 6: Create Submission Package

1. Compress the QuickHire folder into a ZIP file
2. Name the ZIP file "QuickHire_YourName_Submission.zip"

## Step 7: Submit Your Project

Submit your ZIP file according to your teacher's instructions.
